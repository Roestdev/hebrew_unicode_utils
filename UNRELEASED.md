### Current practices   

   *On the Internet, certain ways have already been established for displaying Hebrew text.* 
   *The idea is to include functionality that is already used by various websites.*

   *One example is the [BlueLetterBible](https://www.blueletterbible.org/wlc/gen/1/1/s_1001), where it is possible to show  cantilation marks and or vowel points on top of the consonants.* 

   *The implementation usually consists of the following components:*
  - **Consonants:** Show only *consonants* with the *Maqqef's* and *Sof Pasuq's*.   
  - **Vowels:** Show *consonants* + all *vowels*.   
  - **Accents:** Show *Vowels* + all *accents.*
